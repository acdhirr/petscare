## Cats care

### Feeding
- Cats will be feeded by the robot from 21:00 - 6:00. The robot contains food pellets that both cats digest well. 
- During the day it's okay to pick your own moments for feeding as long as it will be more or less always at the same time so the cats can expect when to be feeded.
- Feeding portions are about 20 dry pellets per feeding for each cat. Both cats have there own jar of dry pellets. 
- Call the cats before feeding (or shake the pellets) so both will eat at the same time (otherwise one will eat twice and the other one gets nothing).
- Once a day Balou needs a strip of about 5cm anti-hairball paste from the tube. Just put it on top of the pellets, no need to mix. Cats love the taste so once in a while it's okay to give Momo some as well. 
- Once every few days or so you may replace one meal with halve a pouch of soft food (both cats can eat from the same pouch).
- Water should be available abundantly because food consists mainly of dry pellets. Usually besides the drinking bowl in the kitchen I leave a small pan filled with water downstairs in the kitchen on the ground floor. Balou loves to drink from a dripping tap so if he jumps onto the kitchen top you may let him.

### Living space
- Cats can use all rooms from the ground floor up to the top floor. Some obstacles must be placed between the door frames and the doors because Balou will close the doors shut without knowing how to open them, only for Momo to be able to set him free...
- Cats use the side balcony but not the terrace on the sleeping floor. When unattended Balou will climb over the fence of the terrace on the sleeping floor to the neighbouring terraces. Usually he'll come back after a while if you leave the gate open, but that's probably not something you will want to wait for. So if you insist you can go there as long as you'll keep an eye on him.
- Beware for the cats not to run on the street once you open the front door. Mostly they will be to shy to do so, but you never know.
- Some furniture is covered in sheets for protection against too many cat hairs. 
- If in any case a cat jumps or falls of the balcony and you cannot find it immediately, unscrew the plate from the cat door at the ground floor, so they can use that  door to re-enter the house. It's a one way door so they cannot use it to go out again, but other cats (neighbours) may try as well and they'll be trapped inside the house until you set them free.
- Balou mostly uses the bunk bed on the top floor to 'chill', while Momo mostly hides in the closet with the sliding doors in the large sleeping room.

### Sanitary
- There are two cat toilets that must be cleant ideally every day by scooping out the poop and the lumps. And then throw in half a bucket of fresh cat litter. 
- Once every 10 days usually we refill the entire toilet and take out the trash.

### Hairball puking 

Momo seldom pukes, but Balou does once in a while. When Balou throws up usually there's a hairball stuck in his digestive system. His intestants may get upset but Balou doesn't suffer too much and still is hungry. It's best to keep him on a diet of soft food mashed with water and the usual anti-hairball paste until the puking stops. At nights he may still eat pellets coming from the robot, which is unavoidable, but okay. You may give Momo some soft food as well then, because she will be attracted to Balou's food and try to push him away to steal it. During periods of throwing up it's best to keep the sleeping rooms on the top floor shut to prevent Balou from soiling the beds.
