## Cats care
<img src="photo/PXL_20220626_214820633.jpg" width="600" />

### Feeding
- Cats will be feeded by the robot from 21:00 - 6:00. The robot dispenses food pellets that both cats digest well. 
- During the day it's okay to pick your own moments for feeding as long as it will be more or less always at the same time so the cats can expect when to be feeded.
- Feeding portions are about 20 dry pellets per feeding for each cat. Both cats have there own jar of dry pellets. 
- Call the cats before feeding (or shake the pellets) so both will eat at the same time (otherwise one will eat twice and the other one gets nothing). Maybe you need to go searching after Momo because initially she will be very reluctant, though once she knows you she's a lot bolder.
- Once a day Balou needs a strip of about 5cm paste from the tube of anti-hairball agent. Just put it on top of the pellets, no need to mix. Cats love the taste of it so once in a while it's okay to give Momo some as well. 
- Once every few days or so you may replace one meal with halve a pouch of soft food (both cats can eat from the same pouch).
- Water should be available abundantly because food consists mainly of dry pellets. Usually besides the drinking bowl in the kitchen I leave a small pan filled with water downstairs in the kitchen on the ground floor. Balou loves to drink from a dripping tap so if he jumps onto the kitchen top you may let him do so.

### Living space
- Cats can use all rooms from the ground floor up to the top floor. Some obstacles must be placed between the door frames and the doors because Balou will close the doors shut without knowing how to open them, only for Momo to be able to set him free...
- Cats use the side balcony but not the terrace on the sleeping floor. When unattended Balou will climb over the fence of the terrace on the sleeping floor to the neighbouring terraces. Usually he'll come back after a while if you leave the gate open, but that's probably not something you will want to wait for. So if you insist you can go there as long as you'll keep an eye on him.
- Beware for the cats not to run on the street when you open the front door. Mostly they will be to shy to do so, but you never know.
- Some furniture is covered in sheets for protection against too many cat hairs. 
- If in any case a cat jumps or falls of the balcony and you cannot find it immediately, unscrew the plate from the cat door in the back door of the house on the ground floor, so they can use that door to re-enter the house. It's a one way door so they cannot use it to go out again, but neighbour cats may try as well and they'll be trapped inside the house until you set them free.
- Balou mostly uses the bunk bed on the top floor to 'chill', while Momo mostly hides in the closet with the sliding doors in the large sleeping room.

### Sanitary
- Cat sanitary is on the side balcony next to the kitchen. There's a small push lamp beneath the roof in case you'll arrive after sunset.
- There are two cat toilets that must be cleant ideally every day by scooping out the poop and the lumps. And then throw in half a bucket of fresh cat litter. 
- Once every 10 days usually we refill the entire toilet and take out the trash.

### Hairball puking 

Momo seldom pukes, but Balou does once in a while. When Balou throws up usually there's a hairball stuck in his digestive system. His intestants may get upset but Balou doesn't suffer too much and still is hungry. It's best to keep him on a diet of soft food mashed with water and the usual anti-hairball paste until the puking stops. At nights he may still eat pellets coming from the robot, which is unavoidable, but okay. You may give Momo some soft food as well then, because otherwise she will try to push Balou away and eat his food. During periods of throwing up it's best to keep the sleeping rooms on the top floor shut, to prevent Balou from soiling the beds. 

### General cat remarks

Momo and Balou are brother and sister and they get along very well. Sometimes they have a little fight. Fluff will be flying around but nothing too harmfull will happen. Momo has some authority over Balou, but Balou is stronger and Momo knows it. 


## GUINEA PIG CARE

<img src="photo/PXL_20220615_110935700.jpg" width="600" />

### Feeding

- Guinea pigs usually get some fresh food in the morning.
- In the evening they get: 
    - a full bowl of mixed food (seeds and grains etc.) 
    - some fresh food
    - two handfulls of hay (put it on the terrace when it's dry)
    - a fresh can of water (hanging on the fence). Just refill, no cleaning needed.
- Fresh food can be anything vegetables or fruit: 
    - cucumber, carrot (with leaves), radish (with leaves), lettuce, paprika (bell pepper), tomato 
    - brocolli/cauliflower or cabbage (but not more then two days in a row)
    - apple, pear, banana, grapes, strawberries, peach, orange etc. but they do not fancy too sweet fruits
    - NOT: leek or anything related to onions, potatoe, beans, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant), mushrooms, paprika leaves, tomato leaves or hot peppers (just saying :-)
    - We'll leave some cash money to buy fruit or vegetables. Just across the street in the former church building which now houses a mosque there's a nice little turkish shop (called Arzem) run by a very sympathetic owner, selling fresh fruit and vegetables.

### Living space

- Guinea pigs live on the balcony 24/7 during the summer months. They sleep in the wooden shed but the shed door remains open all day and night. 
- There's a small push lamp beneath the roof of the shed too. Use it for your convenience, the piggies don't need it.
- The cats and guinea pigs can get along very well, so don't mind the cats passing the piggie perimeter or even entering the wooden shed.

### Sanitary

- Unluckily, the guinea pigs use the entire area and the shed as a toilet. So after a week or so the shed desperately needs some fresh wood chips. We'll tidy the wooden shed the day we leave. To clean the shed proceed as follows:
    - nudge the piggies outside the shed
    - close the shed door
    - scoop out the soiled floor covering (along with the newspapers beneath) and trash it in the iron kitchen bin. You can use the brush and dustpan for it. They are kept under the cat roof on the other side of the balcony, to keep them safe for the rain and the rodents gnawing.
    - put in a fresh layer of newspapers and wood chips (2 cm)
    - let the piggies re-enter the shed.

Old newspapers, hay and wood chips can be found in the kitchen closet with the louvre doors or under the large indoor guinea pig cage.   
There's also a box there with spare food.  
Note: guinea pig urine can have a creamy opaque color. This is normal.

### General guinea pig remarks

The guinea pigs are a tight group, but you will have to keep an eye on them to see if they start quarreling and pulling each others hairs. Also they may steal each others vegetable or fruit, so it's best to hand them their portions individually and simultaneously. When it gets too bad (not likely) you may always decide to split the group and put some individuals in the large cage in the kitchen. Also when a guinea pig looks weak or in bad shape you can put him or her under observation indoors. But then of course please call us.


# GENERAL

- Some lamps on the ground floor and in the living area are programmed to switch on and off randomly during the late evening and early morning.
- Could you please water the indoor plants once a week? We'll take the first turn the day we leave.
- You may always skip a feeding moment when that's convenient for you but then please give some extra food beforehand especially to the guinea pigs. Best not to give the cats too much at once or they'll be so greedy they can't keep it in.

Make yourself at home anytime. Use the wifi if you want to (login credentials on a paper at the side of the refrigerator). Downstairs is a coffee machine. In the kitchen on the living floor there's a water kettle and ground coffee and tea. We'll leave some snacks as well. Take a friend with you if you need assistance and just call us in case anything is unclear or you can't find something, or something unexpected happens. Don't hesitate to call or send us a message!

Thank you so much for taking on this task and good luck!
